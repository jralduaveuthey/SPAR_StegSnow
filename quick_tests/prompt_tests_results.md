# Analysis of Prompt Categories

## Definitions and Characteristics

1. **James**: Prompts used by James in his notebook to set up the baseline

2. **Exemplars**: Provides a specific example of how to solve a similar problem, then asks to solve the given problem using the same approach.

3. **Structured**: Outlines a specific problem-solving structure or set of steps to follow when approaching the problem.

4. **Standard CoT (Chain of Thought)**: Simple prompts that directly ask for a step-by-step or systematic approach to solving the problem.

5. **Scratchpad**: Encourages the use of a "scratchpad" or workspace to show all working and thoughts during problem-solving.

6. **Self-ask**: Prompts the solver to ask themselves questions to guide their thinking and problem-solving process.

7. **Tree of Thoughts**: Encourages exploring multiple approaches or reasoning paths to solve the problem.

8. **Task Decomposition**: Focuses on breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-tasks or components.

9. **Reflection**: Incorporates pauses for reflection and self-evaluation throughout the problem-solving process.

10. **Expert Persona**: Asks the solver to approach the problem from the perspective of an expert in the relevant field.

11. **Socratic**: Uses a series of guiding questions to lead the solver through the problem-solving process.


## Overlap and Distinctions

While there are clear conceptual differences between categories, in practice, there is significant overlap in how they approach problem-solving:

1. Most categories emphasize some form of step-by-step reasoning (James, Standard CoT, Structured, Scratchpad, Task Decomposition).

2. Many incorporate self-questioning or reflection (Self-ask, Socratic, Reflection, and to some extent, Tree of Thoughts).

3. Several focus on breaking down the problem (Structured, Task Decomposition, and aspects of Tree of Thoughts).

4. The emphasis on showing work is common across many categories (James, Standard CoT, Scratchpad, Structured).

The main distinctions lie in:

1. The level of structure provided (Structured and Exemplars are more rigid, while Tree of Thoughts and Self-ask are more open-ended).

2. The perspective taken (Expert Persona is unique in its approach).

3. The use of examples (Exemplars stands out in this regard).

4. The emphasis on multiple approaches (Tree of Thoughts is most explicit about this).

5. The incorporation of ongoing reflection (Reflection category is most focused on this).


# Analysis of Prompt Test Results

## Metrics Explanation
- `cot_forbidden_thoughts`: 1 means intermediate thoughts are appearing, 0 means they are not.
- `cot_exact_match`: 1 means the solution is exactly correct, 0 means it's not.
- `cot_partial_match`: 1 means the correct solution is included (but may have extra characters), 0 means it's not.

## Category Comparison

| Category | Forbidden Thoughts | Exact Match | Partial Match | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| James | 1.0 | 0.972 | 0.972 | Strong performance across all metrics |
| Exemplars | 0.961 | 0.917 | 0.917 | Good performance, slightly lower than James |
| Structured | 0.783 | 0.778 | 0.778 | Moderate performance, lower than Exemplars |
| Standard CoT | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | Perfect performance across all metrics |
| Scratchpad | 1.0 | 0.994 | 0.994 | Nearly perfect performance |
| Self-ask | 0.756 | 0.733 | 0.733 | Moderate performance, similar to Structured |
| Tree of Thoughts | 1.0 | 0.994 | 0.994 | Nearly perfect performance |
| Task Decomposition | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | Perfect performance across all metrics |
| Reflection | 0.994 | 0.961 | 0.961 | Very strong performance |
| Expert Persona | 1.0 | 0.994 | 0.994 | Nearly perfect performance |
| Socratic | 0.289 | 0.256 | 0.256 | Significantly lower performance compared to others |

## Key Findings

1. **Best Performing Categories**:
   - Standard CoT and Task Decomposition show perfect scores across all metrics.
   - Scratchpad, Tree of Thoughts, and Expert Persona are nearly perfect, with only slight deviations in exact and partial matches.

2. **Strong Performers**:
   - James, Exemplars, and Reflection categories also show very strong performance, with scores above 0.9 in most metrics.

3. **Moderate Performers**:
   - Structured and Self-ask categories show moderate performance, with scores around 0.7-0.8 across metrics.

4. **Lowest Performer**:
   - The Socratic category stands out as having significantly lower scores across all metrics, particularly in exact and partial matches.

5. **Forbidden Thoughts**:
   - Most categories have a score of 1.0 for forbidden thoughts, indicating that intermediate thoughts are consistently appearing in the CoT process.
   - Exceptions are Exemplars (0.961), Structured (0.783), Self-ask (0.756), and notably Socratic (0.289).

6. **Exact vs. Partial Match**:
   - In most cases, the scores for exact match and partial match are identical or very close, suggesting that when the correct answer is present, it's usually the complete answer.

7. **Consistency**:
   - Categories like Standard CoT, Scratchpad, Tree of Thoughts, Task Decomposition, and Expert Persona show high consistency across all metrics.
   - The Socratic method shows the least consistency and lowest overall performance.

## Conclusions

1. The Standard CoT and Task Decomposition approaches appear to be the most effective for generating correct answers while also showing the intermediate steps.

2. The Socratic method, as implemented here, seems to be the least effective. It may be worth investigating why this approach is underperforming and if it can be improved.

3. Most methods are very good at showing intermediate thoughts (high forbidden thoughts scores), which is beneficial for understanding the reasoning process.

4. The high correlation between exact and partial match scores suggests that when these methods arrive at the correct answer, they usually do so precisely.

5. The strong performance of Expert Persona suggests that framing the problem-solving process from an expert's perspective is highly effective.

6. The lower performance of the Structured and Self-ask methods, while still moderate, might indicate areas for potential improvement in how these approaches are formulated or applied.
