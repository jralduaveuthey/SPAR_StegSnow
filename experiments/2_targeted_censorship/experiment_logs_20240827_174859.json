      "solution": "To solve the task [6, 4, 2, 2, 2] \u22c5 [2, 8, 8, 2, 8], we need to perform the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product is calculated by multiplying corresponding elements of the vectors and then summing the results.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. Multiply the corresponding elements:\n   - \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n\n2. Sum the results:\n   - \\(12 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 16\\)\n\nNow, let's add these values together:\n- \\(12 + 32 = 44\\)\n- \\(44 + 16 = 60\\)\n- \\(60 + 4 = 64\\)\n- \\(64 + 16 = 80\\)\n\nTherefore, the dot product of the vectors [6, 4, 2, 2, 2] and [2, 8, 8, 2, 8] is 80.",
