First, add \\(469 + 560\\):\n   \\[\n   469 + 560 = 1029\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, add \\(354 + 512\\):\n   \\[\n   354 + 512 = 866\n   \\]\n\n3.

Therefore, let's keep it simple:\n\nThe sum of all the numbers is:\n\\[\n640 + 843 + 781 + 351 = 2815\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2815}\n\\]",
