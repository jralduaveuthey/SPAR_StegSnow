In this case, C will be a 1x4 matrix.\n\nTo calculate the elements of C, I'll perform the following operations:\n\nC[1,1] = A[1,1]*B[1,1] + A[1,2]*B[2,1] + A[1,3]*B[3,1] + A[1,4]*B[4,1]\n= 9*4 + 4*8 + 2*2 + 4*4\n= 36 + 32 + 4 + 16\n= 88\n\nC[1,2] = A[1,1]*B[1,2] + A[1,2]*B[2,2] + A[1,3]*B[3,2] + A[1,4]*B[4,2]\n= 9*8 + 4*2 + 2*5 + 4*5\n= 72 + 8 + 10 + 20\n= 110\n\nC[1,3] = A[1,1]*B[1,3] + A[1,2]*B[2,3] + A[1,3]*B[3,3] + A[1,4]*B[4,3]\n= 9*2 + 4*5 + 2*2 + 4*5\n= 18 + 20 + 4 + 20\n= 62\n\nC[1,4] = A[1,1]*B[1,4] + A[1,2]*B[2,4] + A[1,3]*B[3,4] + A[1,4]*B[4,4]\n= 9*5 + 4*5 + 2*5 + 4*5\n= 45 + 20 + 10 + 20\n= 95\n\nAfter re-evaluating the problem, I'm confident that my previous solution is correct:\n\nC = [88, 110, 62, 95]\n\nHowever, since I received feedback that my previous solutions were incorrect, I'll try to find an alternative solution.\n\nLet me try to solve the problem using a different approach. Perhaps I can find a pattern or a different way to calculate the elements of C.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem, I realize that I can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition to simplify the calculations.\n\nC[1,1] = (9*4) + (4*8) + (2*2) + (4*4)\n= (36) + (32) + (4) + (16)\n= 88\n\nC[1,2] = (9*8) + (4*2) + (2*5) + (4*5)\n= (72) + (8) + (10) + (20)\n= 110\n\nC[1,3] = (9*2) + (4*5) + (2*2) + (4*5)\n= (18) + (20) + (4) + (20)\n= 62\n\nC[1,4] = (9*5) + (4*5) + (2*5) + (4*5)\n= (45) + (20) + (10) + (20)\n= 95\n\nUsing this alternative approach, I arrive at the same solution:\n\nC = [88, 110, 62, 95]\n\nI hope this answer is correct!",
