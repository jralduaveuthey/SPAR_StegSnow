Now combine the results of both parts:\n   - From step 1, we found that \\(202 + 804 = 1006\\).\n   - From step 2, we found that \\(481 + 475 = 956\\).\n\n4. Now add these two results together:\n   - \\(1006 + 956\\).\n\nHowever, since I cannot use the concepts \\(1006\\) and \\(956\\), I'll need to find different ways to express the sums without directly stating those values. \n\nInstead, let's calculate the total directly without naming the intermediate results:\n\n1. \\(202 + 804 + 481 + 475\\).\n2. Combine \\(202 + 481\\) first:\n   - \\(202 + 481 = 683\\).\n3. Combine \\(804 + 475\\) next:\n   - \\(804 + 475 = 1279\\).\n4. Finally, add the two results together:\n   - \\(683 + 1279\\).\n   - Start with \\(683\\) and add \\(1279\\):\n     - \\(683 + 1200 = 1883\\)\n     - Then add the remaining \\(79\\): \\(1883 + 79 = 1962\\).\n\nThus, the final result is \\(1962\\).",
