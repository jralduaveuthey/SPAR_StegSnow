Multiply the first components of each vector:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 3 \\times (2 \\times 2) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 6 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Multiply the third components of each vector:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 6 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n4. Sum the results of these multiplications:\n   \\[\n   (6 \\times 2) + (21 \\times 2) + (6 \\times 2)\n   \\]\n\n5. Factor out the common multiplier:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (6 + 21 + 6)\n   \\]\n\n6.
