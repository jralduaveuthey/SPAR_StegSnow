I'll multiply each element of the first matrix by the corresponding element of the second matrix, and then sum up the results.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n[[2] * [5, 5, 8, 5]] = [[10], [20], [48], [25]]\n[[4] * [5, 5, 8, 5]] = [[20], [40], [96], [40]]\n[[6] * [5, 5, 8, 5]] = [[30], [60], [144], [60]]\n[[5] * [5, 5, 8, 5]] = [[25], [50], [120], [50]]\n\nNow, I'll add up the corresponding elements of each row to get the final result:\n\n[[10, 20, 48, 25], [20, 40, 96, 40], [30, 60, 144, 60], [25, 50, 120, 50]]\n\nSo, the result of the multiplication is:\n\n[[10, 20, 48, 25], [20, 40, 96, 40], [30, 60, 144, 60], [25, 50, 120, 50]]\n\nPlease let me know if this solution is correct or if I need to make any adjustments.",
